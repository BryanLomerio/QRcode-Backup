# QR Code Generator

## Description

This QR Code Generator is a project I created to practice my skills in React.js and working with web elements. It lets users enter text, generate a QR code, and download it as an image.

I built this project to get better at using React.js, managing state, and working with tools like `html-to-image` for saving images. Itâ€™s a hands-on way for me to improve my web development skills.
