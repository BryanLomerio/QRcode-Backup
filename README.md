# QR Code Generator

## Description

This QR Code Generator is a project I created to practice my skills in React.js and working with web elements. It lets users enter text, generate a QR code, and download it as an image.

I built this project to get better at using React.js, managing state, and working with tools like `html-to-image` for saving images. It’s a hands-on way for me to improve my web development skills.

## How It Works

1. **First Load**  
   This is the initial view when the app loads:  
   ![QR Code Initial Load](./src/assets/qr1.png)  

2. **Enter Any Input**  
   You can enter any text, link, or information you want to encode into the QR code. Then click the generate button:  
   ![Enter Input to Generate QR](./src/assets/qr2.png)  

3. **Download Image**  
   Once the QR code is generated, click the download button to save it as an image:  
   ![Download QR Code Image](./src/assets/qr3.png)  

4. **Test It Out**  
   Use any QR scanner to scan the generated QR code and see the encoded information:
